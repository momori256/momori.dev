          In 2020, I began my career as a software engineer at a video game
          company, where I honed my C++, SQL, and C# skills. These skills were
          essential for my main task, which involved developing a version
          management system for digital assets. Through the experience, I
          realized the importance of taking ownership and achieving an outcome.

          I am currently based in Vancouver and actively seeking new
          opportunities. My recent focus has been on low-layer programming
          languages such as C++ and Rust.
